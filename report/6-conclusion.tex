\section{Conclusion and Reflections}

(Write this once your findings and visuals are finalized.)

Summarize:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Key insights discovered
    \item Effectiveness of the visual workflows
    \item Challenges faced in interpreting incomplete or noisy data
    \item Future improvements or extensions (e.g., web dashboards, live geo-visualizations)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Improvements}

Future iterations of the platform could integrate machine learning-based anomaly detection, more robust temporal aggregation controls, and user-customizable dashboards. Integrating user feedback loops could also support collaborative visual sensemaking \cite{heer2008design}.
