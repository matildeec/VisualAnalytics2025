\section{Conclusion and Reflections}

This report has detailed the design, implementation, and application of a visual analytics system aimed at investigating illegal fishing activities within the fictional nation of Oceanus. Through a combination of visualization techniques, interactive features, and a user-centered design approach, we have developed a platform that effectively addresses the research questions posed by the VAST Challenge 2024.

As we reflect on the project, several key insights and lessons emerge.

The main challenge was dealing with such a large and complex dataset, which required careful preprocessing and thoughtful design to ensure that the visualizations remained clear and informative. The choice of a multi-page interface allowed us to compartmentalize different aspects of the analysis, making it easier for users to navigate and focus on specific tasks.

Future iterations of the platform could integrate more advanced analytical techniques, such as clustering algorithms for vessel behavior classification and machine learning-based anomaly detection.
