## Project Description

This project addresses **Mini-Challenge 2** (MC2) of the **VAST Challenge 2024**.

The objective is to investigate the behavior of vessels operating within the Oceanus maritime region using multiple datasets, including transponder ping records, harbor reports, and transaction logs. By analyzing these data sources, the challenge focuses on identifying patterns of suspicious activity to support Oceanus authorities in uncovering potentially illegal or concealed maritime behavior.

This repository includes:
- Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning steps using Python.
- An interactive platform for visualizing dashboards and vessel behaviors over time.
