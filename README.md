## Project Description

This project addresses **Mini-Challenge 2** (MC2) of the **VAST Challenge 2024**.

The objective is to investigate the behavior of vessels operating within the Oceanus maritime region using multiple datasets, including transponder ping records, harbor reports, and transaction logs. By analyzing these data sources, the challenge focuses on identifying patterns of suspicious activity to support Oceanus authorities in uncovering potentially illegal or concealed maritime behavior.

## Features

This repository includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data cleaning, inspection, and transformation.
- **Visual Analytics Application**: The visual analytics application built with Vue 3, Vite, D3.js, and TailwindCSS to explore vessel trajectories, harbor events, and suspicious cargo transactions.
- **Project Report**: LaTeX source files detailing the analytical methodology, design choices, and final answers to the challenge questions.
